Your program must accept one parameter, which is the input file. It will contain a listof rules, then a list of initial
facts, then a list of queries. For each of these queries, the pro-gram must, given the facts and rules given, tell if
the query is true, false, or undetermined

By default, all facts are false, and can only be made true by the initial facts statement,or by application of a rule
fact can only be undetermined if theruleset is ambigu - ous,
for example if I say "A is true, also if A then B or C", then B and C are undetermined.

If there is an error in the input,
for example a contradiction in the facts, or a syntaxerror, the program must inform the user of the problem.


if no facts are initially trye then a simple "=" followed by a new line is used
